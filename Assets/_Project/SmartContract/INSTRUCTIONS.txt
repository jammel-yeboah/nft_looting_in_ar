//!! You need to have NodeJS installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

// 1. INSTALL HARDHAT

    npm i -D hardhat
    npx hardhat

// 2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

    npm i -D @openzeppelin/contracts
    npm i -D @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle
    npm i -D @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan

// 3. UNDER "contracts/", RENAME "Greeter.sol" TO YOUR DESIRED CONTRACT NAME

// 4. UNDER "scripts/" RENAME "sample_script.js" to "deploy{YourContractName}.js" (WITHOUT {} of course)

// 5. ON "deploy{YourContractName}.sol" RENAME ALL THE "Greeter" AND "greeter" FIELDS WITH YOUR CONTRACT NAME. !! PRESERVE ORIGINAL CASE !!

// 6. MAKE SURE the "deploy()" function has the correct contract constructor parameters

// 7. UNDER "scripts/" MODIFY "deploy{YourContractName}.js" WITH YOUR NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ADD ETHERSCAN VERIFICATION CODE JUST AFTER:

    await yourContractName.deployTransaction.wait(5);
    
    // We verify the contract
    await hre.run("verify:verify", {
        address: yourContractName.address,
        constructorArguments: [],
    });

// 8. ON "hardhat.config.js" ADD THIS REQUIRE TO THE TOP:

    require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan");
        
// 9. ON "hardhat.config.js" ADD THESE FIELDS BEFORE "module.exports" part:

    const PRIVATE_KEY = "";
    const MUMBAI_NETWORK_URL = "";
    const POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY = "";

// 10. MODIFY "module.exports" in "hardat.config.js" WITH YOUR NEEDS, LIKE THIS:

    module.exports = {
      solidity: "0.8.7",
      networks: {
        mumbai: {
          url: MUMBAI_NETWORK_URL,
          accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY]
        }
      },
      etherscan: {
        apiKey: POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY 
      }
    };

// 11. COMPILE SMART CONTRACT

    npx hardhat clean
    npx hardhat compile

// 13. RUN "scripts/deploy.js" TO DEPLOY SMART CONTRACT

    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
